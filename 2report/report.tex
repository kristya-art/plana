\section{Introduction}

The aim of this work is to develop a web based information system that enables assignment planning for lecturers in our school at the Department of Technology and Computer Science.
The challenge we face is to create effective planning by involving the teachers themselves in this process. We decided to make a web application that will meet all the requirements and will be created using suitable modern technologies. Technologies such as ASP.NET Core Blazor Server with Entity Framework Core (EFCore) and MS SQL (Microsoft Structured Query Language) for the database were chosen. ASP.NET Core Blazor is a new framework that is gaining popularity. Interestingly, thanks to it, it becomes possible to do the entire application in C\# without using JavaScript.\\

In project 2, we created a prototype. In this work, the system will be detailed and expanded. In particular, the following goals are pursued:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Involvement of lecturers in the planning process.}
Lecturers are able to create and manage their own medium- and long-term deployment plans.
\item \textbf{Grouping of lecturers.} It should be possible to schedule several lecturers for the same module.
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Teachers who join a group can independently manage their assignments related to their common module.
   \item Each teacher can make a group with another lecturers.
   \end{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Grouping of the modules.} The group of lecturers can  choose the group of modules and set themselves to it. This can be done in the form of a proposal for the definitive plan, which is then approved by the person responsible for the planning.
\end{itemize}


This work is a continuation of a project that was completed last semester, In which we have prepared the necessary environment for this project. 
In this work, first we will explain how 	the project was organized and how we used a SCRUM to manage it, then we  carry out an additional analysis of the system in connection with the expansion of the system requirements. We will make changes to the domain analysis. We will expand the topic System Architecture and System Design. And then we will cover the topics Project Implementation and Testing.

%\subsection{Problem Statement}


%\**
%A minimum 3-page high-level narrative about your project. The narrative should not be written from the developer’s perspective, describing the features of the planned system.
%Rather, put yourself into a customer’s role, and write your problem statement as if your imagined customer would write it! —Describe the problem that your customer is facing and his or her suggestions about how a software system could help.
%Your problem statement should be based on your project proposal, revised and improved as necessary.

\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Effort Estimation}
  		
The Bachelor's Thesis  is designed as a 12 ECTS module. This corresponds to a workload of 360 hours. When we are working on a project, we always record our hours of work in an Excel table.
 At the end of the project, we will compare this time with the time allotted for the project. 		
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		
\subsection{Scrum}  	
The foundation of the project organization was Scrum.
 	    Some principles of Scrum could not be achieved since they need a group of more than two people. 
 	    Our work was based on the principles of Scrum like the Empirical Process of Control, the core of Scrum, self-organization, value-based prioritization, etc.
 	    The Empirical Process of Control includes three main ideas, namely transparency, inspection, and adaptation. \\
 	    Transparency: The work is carried out in full trust of all parties involved. Everyone has the courage to keep each other up to date with both good and bad news. \\ 
 	    Inspection: Inspection is carried out by every one in the Scrum Team. The team openly shows the product at the end of each Sprint.			 \\
 	    Adaptation: The team asks constant questions about the progress of work, whether we are on the right way. Depending on this, we can adapt an existing product.		 \\
 	    
 	    At the beginning of the project, we have discussed and estimated all the work that needs to be done. 
 	    Meetings between supervisor and developer are weekly and sometimes bi-weekly.
 	    Each meeting includes a discussion about what has been achieved 
 	    since the tasks have been assigned, what can be improved, and scheduling of future tasks.
 	    
 	    
 	    
 	    
 	    
 \subsubsection{Scrum Roles}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Product Owner: Mr. Pfahrer
 \item Development Team: Shiryagina Kristina
 \item Scrum Master: Shiryagina Kristina
  		
  		\end{itemize}
  	    \subsubsection{Scrum Plan}
  	    To discuss the project, were weekly and biweekly meetings held . They included personal meetings or meetings using Microsoft Teams. The meetings consisted of:
  	    \begin{itemize}
  	    \item Sprint Review. It includes a show of work and its discussion.
  	    \item Sprint Planning. It includes the scheduling of future tasks.
  	    \item Sprint Retrospective. It includes discussion about what went well and what went wrong, what we should do differently.

\subsection{Creating the Database Context Class}

\subsection{Entity Framework Core Configuration}

\subsection{Database and Entity Framework Core}
Entity Framework(EF) Core is an object-relational mapper (O /RM). It is designed to make writing code for accessing a database quick and intuitive.
There are many good reasons to use EF Core. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations. EF Core works with many databases, including SQL Database, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB.
book \cite{efa} \cite{ef}

\subsection{The PLANA App's Relational Database}
Our database has many types of relationships we can have in EF Core. The types are:
One-to-many: Lecturer
Many-to-many:
One-To-Many Relationship : 
Lecturer to an Additional Assignment 
Semester to a Additional Assignment
Semester to a Module Run 
Module to a Module Run
Study Branch to a Module
Many-To-Many Relationship :
Lecturers to Semester
Lecturers to Module
Lecturers to Module Run




\subsection{Modeling Types of Database Relationships}
\subsubsection{Many-to-many Relationship }
Creating many-to-many relationship is little bit different from the one-to-many and one-to-one.
We will take as example relation between Lecturer and Module.\\

In EF Core database doesn't directly implement this kind of relationships.
First we have to create class Lecturer and class Module. Then we have to create one more class, we call it LecturersModules. This class links lecturers to their modules. \\
At the LecturerModules class there are two properties, LecturerId and ModuleId. There are both - primary keys and foreign keys, known as a composite key.\cite{efa}


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{report_img/lecturers-modules.JPG}
\caption{The LecturersModules entity class}
\label{blabla}
\end{figure}

 The next step  is adding necessary code to the AppDbContext class. We add 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{DbSet<Lecturer>} 
 \item \textbf {DbSet<Module>}
 \item \textbf{DbSet<LecturersModules>}
 \end{itemize}
 
 
 
The Figure 2 below shows this process. In the OnModelCreating method we add
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{modelBuilder.Entity<LectuerersModules>().HasKey(x=> new {x.LecturerId, x.ModuleId}};
\end{itemize}


 





\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{report_img/many-to-many.JPG}
\caption{Adding Entity LecturersModules to the AppDbContext class}
\label{blabla}
\end{figure}  
We need write just this and Entity Framework Core will do the correct implementation that we can see then in the migration files. \cite{patrick}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{report_img/Initial.JPG}
\caption{Initial Migration File}
\label{blabla}
\end{figure} 

From Figure 3 we can see that one many-to-many relationship has transformed in two one-to-many and many-to-one relationships.

\subsection{Creating Database}
\newpage
\subsection{Creating a Repository}

todo: photo of repository



In our project we create a repository interfaces and implementation classes.\\
We use \textbf{IQueryable<T> and IEnumarable<T>} interfaces.
With IQueryable<T> interface the objects can be queried in more efficient way.\\
For example: \textbf{public IQueryable<ModuleRun> ModuleRuns => appDbContext.ModuleRuns;} the ModuleRuns property in the context class returns a DbSet<ModuleRun> object, which implements the IQueryable<T> interface.

\noindent                                                                %

Then we create the Repository Service in the Startup.cs file.\\

\subsubsection{Creating the Database Migration, Code-First Migration}
Entity Framework Core makes it possible to generate schema for the database from the data model classes using \textbf{migrations}
\textbf{dotnet em migrations add Initial} 
\cite{core3}



\subsection{Creating Seed Data}
The seed data is the data that is used to populate the database. For seed data we add class SeedData.cs in the Models folder in Plana.Api project \cite{core3}.
%\subsubsection{Delete method in Entity Framework Core}
By default, Entity Framework Core uses cascade deletes for depend relationships with non-nullable foreign keys. \cite{efa} \\
..add photo of seed class (give it name The contents of the SeedData.cs class \\
\subsubsection{Configuration of Core Services and Entity Framework}

It is necessary to make changes in Startup.cs class in Plana.Api project - configure Entity Framework Core and set up the services that will be used to access the database \cite{efa}.\\
The figure below shows all these configurations.
